Tired of managing and tracking your vacations? Have you ever felt frustrated when learning about last-minute schedule changes in flight timings?

Let us take care of all this hassle for you so that you can enjoy your vacation or trip.

<h2>Road Warriors: Transforming the Travel Experience!</h2> 

**Problem Statement:** Build the next-generation online trip management dashboard to allow travelers to view all their existing reservations organized by trip, either online (web) or through their mobile device.

**Our Solution:** Road Warriors, an app that takes care of all your vacation/trip reservations and keeps you up-to-date with them, allowing you to focus on the vacation/trip rather than managing, monitoring, and tracking them.

**Key Features (sub-section):**
- See all the reservations organized into trips. (How? We use our state-of-the-art analytic engine to manage and arrange those trips for you :))
- Receive notifications for any updates to the reservations.
- Gain insights about your travel through various metrics.
- Stay updated on the latest trends that can help you choose your next destination.
- Get assistance for any reservation via Road Warriors.
- Share with your friends on social media how Road Warriors lets you be carefree and enjoy your trips. :)

## Key factors to make Road Warriors successful:

- The app is free.
- One-time configuration/setup to provide a hassle-free vacation/trip experience.
- A single stop for all updates related to reservations.

## Once the MVP has been delivered, Road Warriors can be enhanced with the following features to attract more users:

- The app can provide an option to make bookings/reservations from the app via travel agent services, making it an all-in-one app related to travel for users.
- A dashboard showing travel information comparison with another person (will require permission from the other user). This can help in managing travel plans for friends, where they can view each other's bookings on the dashboard and proceed with their bookings accordingly. This can also be further used to show analytics comparisons between users and could be used as a revenue source by providing suggestions based on friends' trends.
- Analytics services can be used by Road Warriors for revenue generation purposes by advertising/endorsing travel service providers (airlines, hotels, cabs).


  In conclusion, Road Warriors isn't just an app; it's your ultimate travel companion, designed to liberate you from the burdens of trip management. With Road Warriors by your side, you can embark on your journeys with confidence, knowing that every detail is taken care of, and every adventure awaits.
