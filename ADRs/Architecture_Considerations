Here are 5 important reasons why a microservices and event-driven architecture would be suitable for meeting the road warrior requirements:

1. **Scalability for High User Base:** With 2 million active users per week and a total of 15 million user accounts, a microservices architecture can efficiently handle the scalability requirements. Each microservice can be independently scaled up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal resource allocation.

2. **Real-time Updates:** Microservices can be designed to handle real-time updates efficiently. Event-driven architecture, coupled with microservices, allows the system to react instantly to events like email updates, ensuring that travel information is updated in the app within the specified 5-minute window.

3. **Flexibility and Agility:** Microservices provide the flexibility to implement different functionalities as separate services. This aligns with requirements like interfacing with travel agency systems, providing end-of-year summaries, and gathering analytical data. Each microservice can evolve independently, enhancing agility.

4. **Responsive User Interface:** A microservices architecture enables the development of responsive user interfaces tailored to various deployment platforms. This ensures a rich user experience across web and mobile devices, meeting the specified response time requirements.

5. **Interoperability and Integration:** Microservices can seamlessly integrate with existing travel systems like SABRE and APOLLO, as required. Additionally, the event-driven approach allows for easy integration with external systems, such as preferred travel agencies, to facilitate quick problem resolution and international compatibility.

By adopting a microservices and event-driven architecture, the system can efficiently handle the high traffic, real-time updates, and diverse functionalities outlined in the requirements while ensuring high availability and a responsive user interface.
